  heading: The Tension of Hope
  quotes:
    - text: |-
        We started 2025 with big hopes. Coming off a strong 2024, we met in Chicago, strengthened relationships, and placed real belief in what this year could become.  Hope felt earned, reasonable, and it felt shared.

        And then the year began to answer back.

        That hope met reality.  Uncertainty surfaced. Hard decisions followed. Shifting priorities, real-world constraints, and an unpredictable external landscape added weight to the work. Working fully remote amplified it all. Much of what shaped us felt outside our direct control, and that pressure was unmistakable.

        We weren’t just moving through a new year.  We were being tested.

        At its core, our work is belief – belief in higher education, in its impact, and in its potential to transform lives. And belief, we learned this year, isn’t something you simply hold. It’s something you test.  Belief lives in the space between aspiration and reality.  Between what we hope for and what’s actually possible.  Sometimes you fall short. Sometimes you surprise yourself. And sometimes you realize you could have aimed higher. That space is _tension_.

        And tension, while uncomfortable, is where growth happens. Growth doesn’t always _feel_ good, but it does something essential. It strengthened our belief. This year asked more of us: more trust in each other, more intentional in our decisions, and more courage than felt comfortable. We learned that hope won’t always look like reassurance or ease. Sometimes it looks like resistance.

        We’ve heard that “Higher ed isn’t worth it?” We respond without hesitation: “That’s outrageous.” Choosing to believe otherwise — and to do the work that makes that belief real — is why we exist. We’re not here _just_ to deliver work, but to strengthen the belief itself.

        That tension is the point. It’s what keeps belief from becoming passive and turns it into action. It’s what separates timid ideas from audacious ones, and busy work from work that actually moves higher education forward.

        So, here’s to 2025: a year that tested our belief and, in doing so, sharpened it. Hope no longer looks like optimism.  It looks like conviction.

        The tension will meet us again.  It always does.  The question isn’t whether it will be there in 2026.  The question is, **“Will you stay in the tension long enough to turn the hope into impact?”**

        We have received SO many compliments on the branding – visual and messaging – which has been really great and I wanted to pass along of course.

It was incredibly fulfilling and meaningful to me professionally so thank you all for your great work – for giving us something to put out there we can be so proud of!
