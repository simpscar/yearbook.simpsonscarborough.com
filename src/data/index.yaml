        In 2024, we started towards a three-year vision based on transforming our agency to be both sought-after and recognized for its results. As we stare down the final weeks of the second year of this vision, it's clear that achieving these goals is just on the horizon. In 2024, we faced challenges head-on and showed up for our clients, the industry, and each other in meaningful ways. And while our work can sometimes feel challenging, our team has shown the kind of grit that makes us exceptional.

        This time last year, our agency felt like it was standing at a crossroads. There were uncertainties to navigate and areas where we knew we needed to grow—not just in what we do, but in how we worked together and partnered with clients. Over the past year, we've closed many of those gaps, building trust and leaning into the strengths that set us apart.

        I say this all the time, but I truly mean it—this year, we've done some of our best work. Our work speaks for itself. We are becoming who we said we would be, despite the challenges and in the midst of a constantly shifting landscape. We've delivered award-winning work, presented top-tier insights, created spaces that resonate with our beloved CMOs, refined our service offerings, optimized our processes, reconnected at our retreat in Chicago, and locked in a clearer sense of direction as we continue to evolve.

        Looking ahead, I see us leaning even further into what makes us extraordinary. At SimpsonScarborough, we don't just meet expectations — we outthink them. We don't just deliver—we outshine. And when the stakes are high, we outdo. These aren't just words; they're the reputation we've built as the gold standard in higher education marketing and branding. In 2025, we'll continue to go all out — refining how we approach our work, taking on bold challenges, and driving results that matter for our clients and for each other.

        Thank you for everything you've brought to the table this year. Your efforts matter, and the impact we're creating together is something to be proud of. I'm grateful to work alongside such a talented and dedicated team, and I'm confident that the best is still ahead.

        You hit the ball out of the park — what that means is you brought branding, vision, and a major fundraising campaign into a coordinated effort. Something not easily accomplished in this space.

        Working with SimpsonScarborough has been a transformative experience for our college. Their attentiveness to our feedback and willingness to incorporate every nuance of our brand vision made them feel less like an agency and more like a trusted partner who had worked with us for years.  

        Thanks to their guidance, the positive changes we've seen in our brand's presence are undeniable. We feel more aligned with our brand and its personality than ever, and SimpsonScarborough's support continues to reinforce our success.
